# Description
GUI program for conversion of DCIMG image/video files (associated with Hamamatsu scientific cameras) to the TIFF format for compatibility with downstream applications.

Uses MEX files from https://github.com/bluerose73/dcimg-reader

Currently only Windows is supported.

# Installation
Download the installation .exe file at ./release/package/.  Run the installation wizard and follow onscreen instructions.

# Use
1. Run DCIMG2TIFF_UI.exe.
2. Click `Choose files...` and select the TIFF files you wish to convert.
3. Click `Convert` and wait for process to complete.

Note: by default, the application mirrors the horizontal axis for historical reasons, but this can be disabled by unchecking the `Flip image horizontally` checkbox.
